Objects:

Almost everything in javascript is an object.

Primitives: 
    Numbers, Strings, Booleans, Undefined, Null

Everything else is an object.

A class is called a constructor or prototype in js
Constructors create instances.

In Js, inheritances is achieved by the prototype property of each object

Object instances also have a prototype property.
A constructor's prototype inherits from the Object's prototype.

This is called the prototype chain.

First class functions
Functions are also objects!
We can store them in a variable and pass them as arguments!
Return a function from a function
